Welcome to my _blog_ about learning Tech, Mentality, Business and anything else I find interesting! In this post, I will share my journey as I build a Dev Support platform for developer facing companies. Btw, if you think why this looks like a paper design, it's because I like to <strong>keep things simple</strong> cause they're <strong>effective</strong>. Also, the story starts somehwere in the mid 2022, when I was doing my Eletrical Engineering and started learning about IoT development for my final year projects and I :

<br>

1. **Stumbled across the problem**: Developer facing companies often find it difficult to cope up with maintaining their docs for their products; on the other hand, their new users like me find it difficult to fiddle through their docs to find relevant API calls, Syntax and SDK examples to use their stuff.

<br>

2. **Found solutions**: So I searched through the internet but there weren't many value for money products, most of them were highly paid b2b saas which on board you to try a demo on your docs and blah blah, no one wants that long onboarding and then pay 150+$ per month for a RAG<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#fn-1" aria-label="Footnote 1">1</a></sup> app.

<br>

3. **Started Learning Web Dev to make one**: So I started learning netowrking, web dev, heck even, I used to bunk classes at times to go and learn CS courses that I didn't even opt in. So far, I've learnt FastAPI, ExpressJS, React and Databases. Recently, I've been learning TS and Astro and by now you might know that this blog is made with Astro.

<br>

4. **Cooking the MVP**: MVP is almost done, I'm just testing the core functionalities of the app right now and cooking another small but valuable feature called "analytics" on user's documention to find gaps. once these two are done, I will be refining and releasing it in Beta. It's always better to launch a broken MVP and build from there, than to launch a completely working one that no one wants.

<br>

## What's next

<br>

I will finish the backend soon (cuz it's boring to show the backend, isn't it?), and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

          A RAG app helps you get precise answers from your own fed information quickly and easily, without having to read through everything yourself. Imagine a bot that already knows the documentation you want to find your API call in and answers you as needed.
