# Simple things are the best!

Published on: 2025-05-05

Welcome to my _blog_ about learning Tech! Here, I will share my  journey as I build a Dev Support platform for developer facing companies.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Stumbled across the problem**: Developer facing companies often find it difficult to cope up with maintaining their docs for their products; on the other hand, their new users like me find it difficult to fiddle through their docs to find relevant API calls, Syntax and SDK examples to use their stuff. 

2. **Finding solutions**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **I will write this tomorrow**

## What's next

I will finish the backend soon (cuz it's boring to show the backend, isn't it?), and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
